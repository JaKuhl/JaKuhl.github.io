            <p>The Guitartuna app allows users to tune their guitar, learn new chords 
            and play the latest songs. The new feature "The Ring" is designed for users 
            to interact with the app in a new way.</p>

            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            

            <p>In order to further develop my skills in product development and app design, I used my free time to find my own "real" projects. After a long search, 
                I finally discovered the website "99Design.de". Here, designers and artists can take part in competitions in various fields after successfully applying.
                <br><br>

                In the field of "web and app design", I was able to take part in an exciting design competition. 
                The aim was to develop a first design proposal for a new app feature. Through my own experience of using the app, I knew how well-known the app was among musicians, 
                which is why the competition piqued my interest in many ways.
                <br><br>
                I would like to explain my process from my own ideas to the finished design proposal, with which I was later able to win the competition, in more detail below.

            <h3>Project goal</h3>

            <div>
            <p>The organiser specified an app design screen as the competition deliverable. 
                The requirements for this design screen were formulated as follows: </p>
                <br>

                <ol>
                    <li>Add a new design element in the lower third, here called RING.</li>
                    <li>When the app is started, the ring shows the countdown of how many strings still 
                        have to be tuned (6 -> 5 -> 4... 1) and rotates this number to the middle.</li>
                    <li>As soon as the 6th string is tuned, the RING rotates briefly 
                        and displays the songs that the user can play. Users can then manually rotate 
                        the RING to find a song they like</li>      
                </ol>
          
                <br>
            <p>For illustration purposes, two drawings were provided by the organiser, which explain the new product feature in more detail.</p>

            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            
    
            <p>I was able to put myself in the user's shoes very quickly because I was used to using the app myself. 
                At the beginning, I was particularly worried about designing the ring, as I was only familiar 
                with a few programmes for modelling 3D objects, which are also rather tedious to learn. 
                The tight time frame of the competition of one week did not allow for the necessary familiarisation. 
                Due to these circumstances, I was and am very proud of the result of my ring, which I was able
                 to achieve in only a few working hours in Vectary. <br><br>
    
                In addition, the communication with the customer worked very well. 
                The customer responded quickly and honestly and also contributed his own ideas.<br><br>
                
                For a similar project I would try to structure my design screens better. I unfortunately failed to carefully 
                name and group all the objects on my screen, which cost me a lot of time in later adjustments. 
                With every improvement I had to make in Figma, I realised how important it is to build up 
                your work well and to sort all objects neatly. <br><br>
                
                In addition, for a next project I will take care to document my work steps better and to save important
                 documents in a suitable place. This way, when you look back on your projects, you can better understand 
                 how your own process to the finished product went and analyse it better.
