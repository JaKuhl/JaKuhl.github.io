            <p>With Cliniserve's Patient App, patients receiving hospital care can send requests 
            to nursing staff. After several years of active use on the units within different 
            hospitals, the overall look and structure of the app should be adapted and improved.</p>

            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            

            <p>During my practical semester in the product management department of Cliniserve, 
                I had the opportunity to get to grips with the Patient App. It is used in various German hospitals.
                <br><br>

                There are two different versions of the Patient App: on the one hand, there is the mobile smartphone app,
                 and on the other, the so-called terminal app. This terminal app is used by patients who have a so-called 
                 bedside terminal. These terminals are tablets that are fixed to the corresponding hospital bed. 
                 Cliniserve has received an increasing amount of negative feedback, particularly with regard to the terminal app,
                 which is why the product team decided to initiate a comprehensive redesign of the app.
                <br><br>
                I was allowed to use my time as an intern and help the product team with this redesign. I would like to 
                explain below how the entire project went, what the goals were and what challenges we encountered.

            <h3>Project goal</h3>

            <div>
            <p>Based on feedback from clients and caregivers, Cliniserve was able to identify several "pain points".</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Painpoints:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Queries difficult to read</li>
                    <li>Use of keyboard and scroll animations very error-prone</li>
                    <li>Switching between already made requests and the menu not intuitive</li>    
                    <li>Uncertainty of patients whether a request has already been sent</li>  
                </ol>
          
                <br>
                <p>The aim of the project was to create a new design for the terminal app, taking 
                these pain points into account, to test it and to prepare it for implementation.</p>

            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            
    
            <p>I was able to put myself in the user's shoes very quickly because I was used to using the app myself. 
                At the beginning, I was particularly worried about designing the ring, as I was only familiar 
                with a few programmes for modelling 3D objects, which are also rather tedious to learn. 
                The tight time frame of the competition of one week did not allow for the necessary familiarisation. 
                Due to these circumstances, I was and am very proud of the result of my ring, which I was able
                to achieve in only a few working hours in Vectary. <br><br>
    
                In addition, the communication with the customer worked very well. 
                The customer responded quickly and honestly and also contributed his own ideas.<br><br>
                
                For a similar project I would try to structure my design screens better. I unfortunately failed to carefully 
                name and group all the objects on my screen, which cost me a lot of time in later adjustments. 
                With every improvement I had to make in Figma, I realised how important it is to build up 
                your work well and to sort all objects neatly. <br><br>
                
                In addition, for a next project I will take care to document my work steps better and to save important
                 documents in a suitable place. This way, when you look back on your projects, you can better understand 
                 how your own process to the finished product went and analyse it better.
