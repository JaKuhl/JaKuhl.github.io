            hospitals, the overall look and structure of the app should be adapted and improved.</p>

            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            

            <p>During my practical semester in the product management department of Cliniserve, 
                I had the opportunity to get to grips with the Patient App. It is used in various German hospitals.
                <br><br>

                There are two different versions of the Patient App: on the one hand, there is the mobile smartphone app,
                 and on the other, the so-called terminal app. This terminal app is used by patients who have a so-called 
                 bedside terminal. These terminals are tablets that are fixed to the corresponding hospital bed. 
                 Cliniserve has received an increasing amount of negative feedback, particularly with regard to the terminal app,
                 which is why the product team decided to initiate a comprehensive redesign of the app.
                <br><br>
                I was allowed to use my time as an intern and help the product team with this redesign. I would like to 
                explain below how the entire project went, what the goals were and what challenges we encountered.

            </p>

            <h3>Project goal</h3>

            <div>
            <p>Based on feedback from clients and caregivers, Cliniserve was able to identify several "pain points".</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Painpoints:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Queries difficult to read</li>
                    <li>Use of keyboard and scroll animations very error-prone</li>
                    <li>Switching between already made requests and the menu not intuitive</li>    
                    <li>Uncertainty of patients whether a request has already been sent</li>  
                </ol>
          
                <br>
                <p>The aim of the project was to create a new design for the terminal app, taking 
                these pain points into account, to test it and to prepare it for implementation.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>After a short introduction to the objectives of the project, I received sketches from my teacher,
                    which helped me to get a good understanding of the initial thoughts and ideas for the redesign. 
                    I also took some time to get a clear picture of the first ideas and to write down some ideas myself. </p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>After the first ideas were evaluated and we agreed on concrete ideas as a product team, 
                        I began to build the first wireframes in Adobe Xd.  At the beginning, the focus was exclusively 
                        on the placement of the various components. The aesthetic aspects were to be added later. After the 
                        first wireframes were finished and we could get a good feeling for the handling of the new ideas, we as
                        a team noticed improvements again and again. I corrected these ASAP.  After several rounds of improvements, 
                        the new structure of the app was finalised. Due to time pressure, my guidance then took over the aesthetic design of the various screens, 
                        so that we could present finished screens for the construction of a prototype.</p>

                    <p>I was allowed to build a prototype with the finished wireframes, which was to be used 
                        for user testing. For this "user testing" I developed three different scenarios and created
                        a user flow accordingly. Based on the already completed screens, I built individual screens together. 
                        After several feedback loops, we were able to agree on a design screen together. </p>

                    <p>For the "user testing" I developed different tasks that the test persons had to solve. 
                        The online tool "Maze" helped us to explain the scenario and the corresponding tasks, to 
                        share the test environment with all team members and to evaluate the testing afterwards. 
                        We asked all team members to do the testing over the Christmas holidays with a relative,
                        to observe the test subjects accordingly and to share any interesting findings with us.</p>

                        we sat down together as a product team and defined various improvements. 
                        I then implemented these in the screens.</p>

                    of the new design can be planned into the roadmap. In addition, 
                    I familiarised one of the three developers with the entire new design and the path to the new design.</p>

            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            
    
            <p>I was able to familiarise myself with the entire project quite quickly. 
                During the onboarding phase at Cliniserve, I received a detailed explanation of the patient app. 
                This helped me a lot to understand the problems and think about possible solutions. 
                <br><br>
    
                In addition, I was given enough time by my supervisor to get to grips with Adobe Xd.
                It was fun to learn the tool and build the first screens myself. <br><br>
                
                I found the communication in the team very beneficial. The weekly meetings always gave me new ideas 
                and a good overview of my tasks. I really liked the fact that 
                I could work independently and that I always received help with questions and problems. <br><br>
                
                The biggest potential for improvement is in the overall planning of the project. Next time, I would like to have a shared platform for us 
                as a product team to plan and document all the important steps, so that important insights and feedback don't
                get <br><br>

                I really would have appreciated being involved in the actual design of the app, which was ultimately taken over by the permanent product designer 
                due to the time pressure. This could have been prevented by clearer scheduling.
                In the course of the user testing, it became clear to me how important testing in person is. 
                In the next round of testing, I would invest more time in organising live testing.
